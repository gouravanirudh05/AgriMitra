The Livestock Health Division of the Department is supplementing the efforts of State Government for prevention, control and containment of animal diseases by way of providing financial assistance underLivestock Health & Disease Control (LH&DC), which has following components for vaccination:
1	Assistance to States for Control of Animal Disease (ASCAD)- Assistance is provided to State/Union Territory Governments for control of economically important and zoonotic diseases of livestock and poultry by immunization, strengthening of the existing State Veterinary Biological Production Units and of the existing Disease Diagnostic Laboratories
2	Peste des Petits Ruminants Control Programme (PPR-CP) - The programme is presently implemented throughout the country by vaccinating all susceptible sheep & goats for which central financial assistance is provided for vaccination and surveillance.
3	Classical Swine Fever Control Programme (CSF-CP) - To control the CSF disease in pigs, central assistance is provided for vaccination against Classical Swine Fever under the component – ‘Classical Swine Fever Control Programme’ (CSF-CP)	
4	FMD and Brucellosis	Central Sector Scheme “National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP) for control of Foot & Mouth Disease and Brucellosis”: NADCP is a new scheme for control of FMD and Brucellosis disease with 100% central support to states with a financial outlay of Rs.13,343 Cr. for 5 years from 2019 to 2024. It envisages 100% vaccination coverage of cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats and pigs in the country for biannual vaccination against FMD and also envisages 100% vaccination of female cattle and buffalo calves (4-8 months of age) once in a life time against Brucellosis.
